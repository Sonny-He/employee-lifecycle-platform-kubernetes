## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-ready employee lifecycle management platform** deployed on AWS using cloud-native technologies. It automates the complete onboarding and offboarding process, integrating authentication, directory services, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and role-based access control (RBAC).

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Manual employee onboarding/offboarding is: 
- **Time-consuming**: Multiple systems to configure per employee
- **Error-prone**:  Manual steps can be missed or misconfigured
- **Security risk**: Delayed offboarding leaves access exposed
- **Not scalable**:  Doesn't scale with organizational growth

This platform **automates the entire lifecycle** in seconds with zero manual intervention.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture Overview](docs/screenshots/architecture/01-architecture-overview.png)

### Architecture Highlights

- **Multi-tier application** running on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- **Zero Trust security model** with network micro-segmentation via Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
- **Identity integration** with AWS Cognito for authentication and AWS Managed Microsoft AD for directory services
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform for reproducible deployments
- **Self-healing** Kubernetes deployments with automated pod recovery
- **Cost-optimized** using Spot instances, NAT instances, and right-sized resources

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Automated Onboarding
When an admin creates a new employee through the self-service portal, the platform automatically: 

1. ✅ Creates a database record in PostgreSQL
2. ✅ Provisions AWS Cognito user with appropriate group assignment
3. ✅ Creates Active Directory user in the correct Organizational Unit (OU)
4. ✅ Provisions Amazon WorkSpace (VDI) for the employee
5. ✅ Applies role-based tooling and GPO policies based on department
6. ✅ Sends welcome email with credentials (configurable)

**⏱️ Total time:  < 5 minutes (fully automated)**

### 🔒 Automated Offboarding
When an employee is terminated, the platform securely:

1. ✅ Removes employee from the database
2. ✅ Disables Cognito user account
3. ✅ Disables Active Directory account
4. ✅ Terminates Amazon WorkSpace
5. ✅ Revokes all access permissions
6. ✅ Logs offboarding event for audit trail

**⏱️ Total time: < 2 minutes (fully automated)**

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Network micro-segmentation with Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
- **Least Privilege**:  RBAC with Cognito groups (Admin, Developer, Employee)
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: CloudWatch logs for all lifecycle events
- **MFA Support**:  Cognito MFA for administrative access
- **Private Networking**: EKS nodes in private subnets with NAT gateway

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Cognito Groups and RBAC

The platform implements **role-based access control** using AWS Cognito groups:

![Cognito groups](docs/screenshots/rbac/01-cognito-groups.png)

| Group | Permissions | Portal Access |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Admins** | Create/terminate employees, approve access requests | Full access |
| **Developers** | View directory, request access | Limited access |
| **Employees** | View own profile, request access | Read-only |

---

### Kubernetes Network Micro-segmentation

Network access is restricted using **Kubernetes NetworkPolicies** to enforce Zero Trust principles:

![NetworkPolicy describe output](docs/screenshots/kubernetes/02-networkpolicy-employee-portal.png)

#### Network Policy Rules:
- Frontend can only communicate with backend on port 5000
- Backend can only access PostgreSQL on port 5432
- Database accepts connections only from backend pods
- Default deny policy for all other traffic

---

### Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Encryption at rest** (EBS volumes, RDS)  
✅ **Encryption in transit** (TLS for all API calls)  
✅ **Private subnets** for EKS nodes and database  
✅ **Security groups** with least-privilege rules  
✅ **IAM roles** for service accounts (IRSA)  
✅ **Secrets management** via Kubernetes Secrets  
✅ **CloudWatch logging** for audit trails  
✅ **MFA enforcement** for admin accounts  

---

## 🚦 Reliability Evidence

### Self-Healing Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes automatically recreates failed pods:

![Self-healing demo](docs/screenshots/kubernetes/01-self-healing-pod-delete.png)

**Demo**:  Deleting a pod triggers the Deployment controller to recreate it within seconds, ensuring zero downtime.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have: 

- **AWS Account** with sufficient permissions
- **Terraform** 1.6+ installed
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials
- **kubectl** installed
- **Docker** (for building container images)
- **PowerShell** 7+ (for setup scripts)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sonny-He/employee-lifecycle-platform-kubernetes. git
cd employee-lifecycle-platform-kubernetes
```

#### 2. Configure Terraform Variables

Edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
aws_region         = "eu-central-1"  # Your AWS region
project_name       = "employee-lifecycle"
environment        = "production"
eks_cluster_name   = "employee-platform-eks"

# Cost management
budget_alert_emails = ["your-email@example.com"]
monthly_budget_limit = 200

# Domain configuration (optional)
# domain_name = "yourdomain.com"
```

#### 3. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform (first time only)
terraform init

# Review the plan
terraform plan

# Deploy infrastructure (takes ~20 minutes)
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

#### 4. Run Post-Deployment Setup

This script configures kubectl, ECR, database, and Cognito:

```powershell
cd automation/scripts
./post-deployment-setup1.ps1 -AWS_PROFILE student
```

The script will:
- Configure kubectl to access EKS cluster
- Create ECR repositories
- Build and push Docker images
- Initialize PostgreSQL database schema
- Create Cognito admin user
- Deploy Kubernetes manifests

#### 5. Access the Portal

After setup completes, get the portal URL:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n employee-services
```

Open the LoadBalancer URL in your browser and login with: 
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `AdminPass123!` (change this in production!)
